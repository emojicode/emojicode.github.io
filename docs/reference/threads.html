	<h1 id="threads">Threads</h1>
<p>Emojicode offers concurrency, that is doing more than one thing at a time,
and allows you to create threads, which can each independently execute code.</p>
<h2 id="creating-threads">Creating threads</h2>
<p>Threads are represented by the 💈 class of the s package. You can create a new
thread by using the 🆕 initializer which accepts a callable which will be called
on the newly created thread.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>🔷💈🆕 🍇
  😀 🔤I execute on a different thread.🔤
🍉
</code></pre><p>If you wrapped the above into the 🏁 method compiled it into a program, you
would possibly not see any output. The problem is, that the thread is created
and the main thread, on which the 🏁 method was called, would continue to
execute and would finally reach the end of the program. The program would
likely terminate before the second thread had the chance to do anything.</p>
<p>In order to avoid this, you can wait for another thread to terminate with the
help of the 🛂 method. If the thread has already finished the 🛂 will
immediately return. The example below creates 5 threads (creating one
thread and waiting for it doesn&#39;t make much sense) and then waits for each to
finish.</p>

Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
</code></pre><p>The output is randomly ordered because all threads are trying to execute
simultaneously. The order in which a thread will get the opportunity to actually
print something depends on your hardware as well as many other factors, like
load factor of the computer.</p>

🍉
</code></pre><p>It creates a bank account with an initial credit balance of 300€. Then 10
threads are created which each try to withdraw 10€ 5 times if there is money
left. You might now expect that the balance will be 0€ in the end because the
threads only tried to get more money when available but never overdraw the
account. Let’s try.</p>
<pre><code>...
Money, money, money – Must be funny
Money, money, money – Must be funny
-70
</code></pre><p>Strange, let’s try again.</p>
<pre><code>...
Money, money, money – Must be funny
Money, money, money – Must be funny
-40
</code></pre><p>Probably you already now, but what happened here is called a <em>race condition</em>.
Let’s analyze this part of our code again:</p>
<pre><code>🍊 ➡️ 💶 account 10 🍇 👴 There’s money left
  😀 🔤Money, money, money – Must be funny🔤
  💸 account 10
🍉
</code></pre><p>Imagine the following situation: A thread comes and sees that exactly 10€
are left. So the body of the 🍊 is entered and the thread prints
a message. In exactly this moment another thread comes along, checks the balance
and also sees there are 10€ left and enters the body of the 🍊. The former
thread now moves on to withdraw 10€ as the second one will do after it has
printed a message. So they withdrew 20€! In reality the program is even faster
and all threads execute this same piece of code at the same time.</p>
<p>Now how can fix this? The solution is to use an instance of 🔐, which is also
called a <em>mutex</em>. A mutex ensures that only ever one thread can access a data
structure or run a piece of code.</p>
<p>We’ve reworked our example to use a mutex:</p>
<pre><code>🏁 🍇
  🍦 threads 🔷🍨🐚💈🐸

  🍦 account 🔷🏦🆕

  🍦 mutex 🔷🔐🆕

  🔂 i ⏩ 0 10 🍇
    🐻 threads 🔷💈🆕 🍇
      🔂 j ⏩ 0 5 🍇
        🔒 mutex
        🍊 ➡️ 💶 account 10 🍇
          😀 🔤Money, money, money – Must be funny🔤
          💸 account 10
        🍉
        🔓 mutex
      🍉
    🍉
  🍉

  🔂 thread threads 🍇
    🛂 thread
  🍉

  😀 🔡 💶 account 10 👴 Print the balance
🍉
</code></pre><p>If a thread comes to the line <code>🔒 mutex</code> it will try to <em>lock</em> the mutex. If the
mutex is not already locked, that is if no other thread has already passed this
line, the thread will be able to do this and will continue. Otherwise however,
the thread will wait until it itself can lock the mutex. The thread which
grabbed the mutex <em>unlocks</em> the mutex at the end of the critical part by calling
<code>🔓 mutex</code>. At this point another thread can get the chance to lock the mutex –
which thread however depends on your hardware, operating system, etc.</p>
<p>An operation like this which is protected from disturbances by other threads is
called <em>atomic</em>.</p>
<p>And now, no matter how often you try, you will always get the expected result:</p>
<pre><code>...
Money, money, money – Must be funny
Money, money, money – Must be funny
0
</code></pre><h2 id="atomicity-of-the-s-package">Atomicity of the s package</h2>
<p>It’s important to note that none of the classes in the s package guarantee
atomicity. If you access a s package data structures always make sure to use
a mutex to avoid race conditions.</p>
