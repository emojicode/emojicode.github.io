You can create a new thread by using the 🆕 initializer which accepts a callable which will be called on the newly created thread.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>🔷💈🆕 🍇
  😀 🔤I execute on a different thread.🔤
🍉
</code></pre><p>If you wrapped the above into the 🏁 method compiled it into a program, you would possibly not see any output. The problem is, that the thread is created and the main thread, on which the 🏁 method was called, would continue to execute and would finally reach the end of the program. The program would likely terminate before the second thread had the chance to do anything.</p><p>In order to avoid this, you can wait for another thread to terminate with the help of the 🛂 method. If the thread has already finished the 🛂 will immediately return. The example below creates 5 threads (creating one thread and waiting for it doesn&#39;t make much sense) and then waits for each to finish.</p><pre><code>🍦 threads 🔷🍨🐚💈🐸

</code></pre><p>The output is randomly ordered because all threads are trying to execute simultaneously. The order in which a thread will get the opportunity to actually print something depends on your hardware as well as many other factors, like load factor of the computer.</p><h2 id="race-conditions-and-mutexes">Race conditions and mutexes</h2><p>Imagine the following program:</p><pre><code>🐇 🏦 🍇

</code></pre><p>It creates a bank account with an initial credit balance of 300€. Then 10 threads are created which each try to withdraw 10€ 5 times if there is money left. You might now expect that the balance will be 0€ in the end because the threads only tried to get more money when available but never overdraw the account. Let’s try.</p><pre><code>...
Money, money, money – Must be funny
Money, money, money – Must be funny
-70
</code></pre><p>Strange, let’s try again.</p><pre><code>...
Money, money, money – Must be funny
Money, money, money – Must be funny
-40
</code></pre><p>Probably you already know, but what happened here is called a <em>race condition</em>. Let’s analyze this part of our code again:</p><pre><code>🍊 ➡️ 💶 account 10 🍇 👴 There’s money left
  😀 🔤Money, money, money – Must be funny🔤
  💸 account 10
🍉
</code></pre><p>Imagine the following situation: A thread comes and sees that exactly 10€ are left. So the body of the 🍊 is entered and the thread prints a message. In exactly this moment another thread comes along, checks the balance and also sees there are 10€ left and enters the body of the 🍊. The former thread now moves on to withdraw 10€ as the second one will do after it has printed a message. So they withdrew 20€! In reality the program is even faster and all threads execute this same piece of code at the same time.</p><p>Now how can fix this? The solution is to use an instance of 🔐, which is also called a <em>mutex</em>. A mutex ensures that only ever one thread can access a data structure or run a piece of code.</p><p>We’ve reworked our example to use a mutex:</p><pre><code>🏁 🍇

</code></pre><p>If a thread comes to the line <code>🔒 mutex</code> it will try to <em>lock</em> the mutex. If the mutex is not already locked, that is if no other thread has already passed this line, the thread will be able to do this and will continue. Otherwise however, the thread will wait until it itself can lock the mutex. The thread which grabbed the mutex <em>unlocks</em> the mutex at the end of the critical part by calling <code>🔓 mutex</code>. At this point another thread can get the chance to lock the mutex – which thread however depends on your hardware, operating system, etc.</p><p>An operation like this which is protected from disturbances by other threads is called <em>atomic</em>.</p><p>And now, no matter how often you try, you will always get the expected result:</p><pre><code>...
Money, money, money – Must be funny
Money, money, money – Must be funny
0
