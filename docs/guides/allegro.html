This guide assumes that you have have a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming and have read <a href="compile-and-run.html">Compile and Run Your First Program</a>.</p><h2 id="creating-an-app">Creating an app</h2><p>First of all we need to important the allegro package:</p><pre><code>📦 allegro 🔴
</code></pre><p>This makes all types from the <code>allegro</code> package available in the namespace 🔴 (of our package, which by definition is <code>_</code>), i.e. we can access all classes provided by the allegro package from our application.</p><p>Next we need to startup the application, so we’ll create the 🏁 function:</p><pre><code>🏁 🍇
  🍩🙋🏔 🍇 app 🏔

  🍉
🍉
</code></pre><p>As you’ve seen, there’s already some code in the 🏁 function. <code>🍩🙋🏔</code> is a type method call. This means we call a method (🙋) directly on a type (🏔). There’s one more thing to notice: the following code block. This code block creates a closure that takes an argument <code>app</code> of type <code>🏔</code>. Closures are a kind of function that capture the context in which they were created, i.e. the variables and the object on which a method was called.</p><p>So what is this good for? The 🙋 type method of the 🏔 class, which is provided by the allegro package, is really important as it initiates the application in such a way that it can display windows, receive events and play sounds. This method normally doesn’t return but instead calls the given callable in an appropriate way and passes it an instance of 🏔 that represents the created application. We’ll use it to draw in a moment.</p><p>To recap: Call this class method, provide it with a callable and setup the application from there.</p><p>We’ll do so by creating a 📺 instance. A 📺 instance (say <em>display</em>) is responsible for displaying graphics on the computers screen. On many operating systems a 📺 will be represented by a window.</p><p>📺 provides a single initializer:</p><pre class="declaration">
🔓 🐈 🆕 width <a href="../packages/s/1f682.html">🚂</a> height <a href="../packages/s/1f682.html">🚂</a> </pre><p>Our code to get a display is therefore:</p><pre><code>🍦 display 🔷📺🆕 1000 1000
</code></pre><p>Now that we’ve a 📺 instance we can configure it. We’ll set its title:</p><pre><code>🏷 display 🔤Cookie Monster Game🔤
</code></pre><p>That’s good moment to test if things are working so far. If we, however, compiled and ran this program know we wouldn’t see much due to the fact that program would create a display and immediately terminate. So we’ll tell it to wait for a few seconds after the display was created:</p><pre><code>🍩⏲💈 10_000_000
</code></pre><p>Don’t worry, ⏲ takes the number of microseconds to wait. And 10,000,000 microseconds are only 10 seconds. Save the file, compile it and run it. You should see something similar to this:</p><p><img src="/static/img/cookiemonster1.png" width="300"></p><p>Not very impressive, is it? Let’s do something more interesting and draw some cookies onto the screen. <a href="https://github.com/emojicode/cookie-monster
-game/raw/master/cookie.png">Download</a> a cookie image from here, copy it into the directory in which your program is stored.</p><p>In order to display the image on the screen, it must be loaded as a bitmap first. Fortunately there’s a 🖼 - that’s the bitmap class – initializer that can exactly do that. It’s called 📄 takes a path to the image and is declared like this:</p><p>You certainly noted the <code>🚨🌩</code>, which indicates that the initializer might return an error instead of a bitmap object. We must deal with this possibly arising error and do so by simply assuming that there will never be an error:</p><pre><code>🍦 cookieBmp 🚇🔷🖼📄 🔤cookie.png🔤
</code></pre><p>The <code>🚇</code> tells the compiler that we are sure there will never be an error. (If in reality there is an error the program will simply crash. Not very elegant.) For brevity, let&#39;s leave it at that. But make sure that you properly handle errors in a real application.</p><p>Now that we’ve the bitmap, we’ll draw it onto the screen:</p><pre><code>🚿 app 🔷🎨🆕 255 255 255 255
📼 app cookieBmp 500 500
🎦 app
</code></pre><p>Make sure you place this code <em>before</em> <code>🍩⏲💈 10_000_000</code> or you won’t see anything. If everything goes well, you should see a tasty cookie in front of a white background, neatly centered in the display.</p><p>Wondering what’s going on ’cause that’s a bunch of method calls? Well, these are all important drawing functions. And they all have one thing in common: They are methods called on our <code>app</code> and draw to the current drawing target. By creating a display we’ve created a drawing target which was then also set as the current drawing target.</p><p>The 🚿 type method fills the entire drawing target with the given color which was here created by providing RGBA values. The 📼 method then draws a bitmap at the specified coordinates. Last but not least the 🎦 makes all changes visible: Everything you draw is drawn in a backbuffer first and gets visible once you call the 🎦 method.</p><p>Let’s extend our code to also show the cookie monster (<a href="https://github.com/emojicode/cookie-monster-game/raw/master/cookie_monster.png">download</a> here) and an additional cookie:</p><pre><code>📦 allegro 🔴

</code></pre><p>Running this should result in something similar to this:</p><p><img src="/static/img/cookiemonster2.png" width="300"></p><h2 id="power-to-the-classes">Power to the classes</h2><p>Everything works, but frankly, it’s not really future-proof code. Emojicode is an object-oriented language, so everything would be much better with classes.</p><p>First of all, let us create a 🦁 class that represents the Cookie Monster:</p><pre><code>🐇 🦁 🍇
  🍰 x 🚀
  🍰 y 🚀
  🍰 monster 🖼

  🐈 🆕 🍇
    🍮 x 500
    🍮 y 500
    🍮 monster 🚇🔷🖼📄 🔤cookie_monster.png🔤
  🍉

  🐖 🖌 app 🏔 🍇
    📼 app monster x y
  🍉
🍉
</code></pre><p>This is a very basic class. It has three instance variables: <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> that hold the position of the Cookie Monster and <code>bitmap</code> that holds the bitmap. The initializer sets the initial position of the monster to (500, 500) and loads the bitmap. Also, the cookie monster has a method draw itself: 🖌.</p><p>Next, here’s a class for cookies:</p><pre><code>🐇 🍪 🍇
  🍰 cookie 🖼
  🍰 x 🚀
  🍰 y 🚀

  🐈 🆕 🍼 x 🚀 🍼 y 🚀 🍼 cookie 🖼  🍇🍉

  🐖 🖌 app 🏔 🍇
    📼 app cookie x y
  🍉
🍉
</code></pre><p>There’s a difference to the 🦁 class: 🍪🆕 takes a bitmap argument and coordinates. The reason for this is that we want to create multiple cookies later on and they should, of course, share the same bitmap and have different positions. For this reason we’ll instantiate the bitmap once and pass it to all 🍪 instances.</p><p>So let’s update the 🏁 function to use the new classes:</p><pre><code>🏁 🍇
  🍩🙋🏔 🍇 app 🏔
    🍦 display 🔷📺🆕 1000 1000
    🏷 display 🔤Cookie Monster Game🔤

      🖌 cookie app
    🍉

    🎦 app

    🍩⏲💈 10_000_000
  🍉
🍉
</code></pre><p>As you can see we didn’t just replace the drawing calls but also introduced a 🍨 <code>cookies</code> which stores ten randomly placed cookie objects. <code>🔷🎰🆕</code> creates a pseudo-random number generator, an object we can ask for random numbers. We use it to get integers between 50 and 900, which are then converted into 🚀s with 🚂’s 🚀 method. Later on this 🍨 is iterated and 🖌 is called on each cookie.</p><p>If you run the program you’ll see something similar to this:</p><p><img src="/static/img/cookiemonster3.png" width="300"></p><h2 id="check-out-that-event">Check out that event</h2><p>Everything is working fine so far but it’s not a game yet. We need to grant the user a bit of control over the game. In order to achieve this we need to instantiate an <em>event queue</em> which is constantly queried for events.</p><p>First, create the event queue:</p><pre><code>🍦 queue 🔷🗃🆕
⌨️ queue
</code></pre><p>The code above creates an event queue and registers the keyboard as an event source for that queue. Next, a loop which constantly queries the event queue for an event. Such a loop is often referred to as <em>the run loop</em>:</p><pre><code>🔁 👍 🍇
  🍦 event ⏳ queue

🍉
</code></pre><p>The ⏳ method of ⏳ waits for an event to occur and returns it. So the next thing is to classify the event and handle it appropriately. Since we want the Cookie Monster to be movable with the arrow keys we need to check for a key-down event and then check in which direction that Cookie Monster should move.</p><pre><code>🍊🍦 keyboardEvent 🔲 event 📩 🍇
  🍊 😛📟 keyboardEvent 84 🍇
    ⬆️ monster
  🍉
  🍋 😛📟 keyboardEvent 85 🍇
    ⬇️ monster
  🍉
  🍋 😛📟 keyboardEvent 82 🍇
    ⬅️ monster
  🍉
  🍋 😛📟 keyboardEvent 83 🍇
    ➡️ monster
  🍉
🍉
</code></pre><p>Let’s walk through this code: The first line tries to cast <code>event</code> to <code>📩</code>, a key press event. Then we determine which keycode was associated with this event. 84 stands for arrow up, 85 for arrow down, 82 for arrow left and 83 for arrow right. According to these direction, methods get called on <code>monster</code>. And yes, we have yet to implement them in 🦁:</p><pre><code>🐖 ⬇️ 🍇
  🍮 y ➕ y 10
🍉

🐖 ⬆️ 🍇
  🍮 y ➖ y 10
🍉

🐖 ⬅️ 🍇
  🍮 x ➖ x 10
🍉

🐖 ➡️ 🍇
  🍮 x ➕ x 10
🍉
</code></pre><p>This methods obviously just change the coordinates to move the monster accordingly. So there’s just one step left, before you can control the Cookie Monster with the arrow keys. We need to redraw the game in the run loop, i.e. we need to draw everything all over again to make the changes to the Cookie Monster visible:</p><pre><code>🏁 🍇

        🍉
      🍉
    🍉
  🍉
🍉
</code></pre><p>The 🏁 function should now look like above. Note, that we’ve also dropped the delay at the end of the initializer – it’s no longer needed.</p><p>You can now control the monster with your keyboard!</p><h2 id="me-want-eat-cookies">Me want eat cookies</h2><p>So far, so good. But actually the Cookie Monster wants to the eat the cookies and not just to walk underneath them. In order to achieve this, we need to add two methods to the 🦁 class that return the current coordinates of the mouth of Cookie Monster:</p><pre><code>🐖 👉️ ➡️ 🚀 🍇
  🍎 ➕ x 60
🍉

🐖 👇 ➡️ 🚀 🍇
  🍎 ➕ y 70
🍉
</code></pre><p>That’s really nothing special. Since the coordinates stored in the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables point to the top left of the cookie monster, 60 and 70 get added so that the returned coordinates point to the center of the mouth.</p><p>We’ll now replace 🍪’s 🖌 method by a much more advanced method:</p><pre><code>🐖 🖊 app 🏔 monsterX 🚀 monsterY 🚀 ➡️ 👌 🍇
  🍊 🎊🎊➡️ monsterX x ⬅️ monsterX ➕ x 50 🎊➡️ monsterY y ⬅️ monsterY ➕ y 50 🍇
    🍎 👍
  🍉
  📼 app cookie x y
  🍎 👎
🍉
</code></pre><p>Evidently, this method takes two arguments which are the location of the Cookie Monster, or more specifically, its mouth. The next line might be a bit more difficult to understand. It compares whether the coordinate of the Cookie Monster‘s mouth are within the cookie. If that‘s the case the method immediately returns 👍, otherwise the cookie is drawn as usual and 👎 is returned.</p><p>Clearly, we now also need to update our loop to draw cookies:</p><pre><code>🍦 iterator 🔷🌱🐚🍪🆕 cookies
🔂 cookie iterator 🍇
🍊 🖊 🍺cookie app 👉️ monster 👇 monster 🍇
  🚯 iterator
🍉
</code></pre><p>The code above is really straightforward. We create an 🌱 iterator instance for <code>cookies</code>, to which a reference is then stored in <code>iterator</code>. Then this iterator is used with the 🔂 loop to get each cookie. 🖊 is called on each cookie and the coordinates of the monster, which we can get from the new 👉️👇 methods, are passed. If the 🖊 method returns true, this means the Cookie Monsters mouth touched the cookie, the 🚯 method is called on the iterator, which removes the current element from the array. (That’s a special capability of 🌱 and the reason why we created it explicitly.)</p><p>Try running the game now! The Cookie Monster will be happy to eat the cookies.</p><h2 id="scores">Scores</h2><p>Cool game, isn’t it? But it would be nice if there was a counter showing how many cookies there are still left, wouldn’t it? And probably a special screen when the game is finished?</p><p>To recap: We want to display some text. And therefore we need a font. <a href="https://github.com/emojicode/cookie-
monster-game/raw/master/Monoton-Regular.ttf">Download a cool font here</a> and put it into the same directory as <code>cookie.emojic</code>.</p><p>Now we can load that font (and you should do this before the run loop):</p><pre><code>🍦 font 🚇🔷🕉📄 🔤Monoton-Regular.ttf🔤 63
</code></pre><p>The same disclaimer applies again: Don’t skip error checking although we do it here for shortness. <code>🔷🕉📄</code> instantiates a new instance of 🕉, which represents the font. The two arguments are the path to the font and the size of the font.</p><p>In the run loop we’ll draw the number of cookies left:</p><pre><code>🔡 app font 🔡 🐔 cookies 10 990 10 🔷⚖➡️ 🔷🎨🆕 0 0 0 255
</code></pre><p>Place this code before <code>🎦 app</code>. <code>🔡</code> draws a text using the given font. It is define like this:</p><pre class="declaration">🔓 🐖 🔡 font <a href="../packages/allegro/1f549.html">🕉</a> text <a href="../packages/s/1f521.html">🔡</a> x <a href="../packages/s/1f680.html">🚀</a> y <a href="../packages/s/1f680.html">🚀</a> align <a href="../packages/allegro/2696.html">⚖</a> color <a href="../packages/allegro/1f3a8.html">🎨</a> ➡️ ✨</pre><p>Quite a lot of arguments. Most things should be pretty clear. <code>align</code> is a ⚖, an enum, which specifies how the text should be aligned. In our example we used 🔷⚖➡️ to align the text to the right, i.e. the top right corner of the text will always be at the coordinates passed to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p><p>If you try the game now you’ll see a counter in the top right showing how many cookies are left.</p><p>As mentioned before, a screen at the end of the game would be nice:</p><pre><code>🍊 😛 🐔 cookies 0 🍇

</code></pre><p>Obviously, this code should be placed after the 🔂 loop for <code>cookies</code> and before querying for new events. Once all cookies have been collected, you’ll see the following screen:</p><p><img src="/static/img/cookiemonster4.png" width="300"></p><h2 id="the-acoustic-experience">The acoustic experience</h2><p>Our game is missing something really essential: Sound.
