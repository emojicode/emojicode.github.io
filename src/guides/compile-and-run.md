# Compile and Run Your First Program

This guide is a short introduction to Emojicode and assumes you have a basic knowledge of object-orientated programming and familiarity with the command-line.

## The basic structure

All Emojicode source files are named like `file.emojic`. So let’s get started by creating a file called `greeter.emojic` and put some content into it:

```
🐇 🐼 🍇
  🐇🐖 🏁 ➡️ 🚂 🍇
  
    🍎 0
  🍉
🍉
```

This is the minimum structure every program must have. `🐇 🐼￼ 🍇` defines a class called `🐼`. `🐇🐖 🏁 ➡️ 🚂 🍇`
defines a class method called `🏁`, which returns `🚂`, an integer. `🍎 0` returns the value.

When a program is run the class method `🏁` is called to start the program. Therefore every program must have exactly one class method called `🏁`.

## Greetings

As you can see our program does not do anything at the moment, so let’s add a greeting.

```
🐇 🐼 🍇
  🐇🐖 🏁 ➡️ 🚂 🍇
    😀 🔤Howdy, partner!🔤
    🍎 0
  🍉
🍉
```

Before analyzing this new code we’ll give it a try.

>!H You must have installed Emojicode to run the following commands. See [Installing Emojicode](install.html) if you
>!H haven’t already.

Open a command-line and navigate to the directory containing `greeter.emojic`. Then run this command.

```
emojicodec greeter.emojic
```

This asks the compiler to compile `greeter.emojic`. If everything goes well it should exit without a message and generate a file called `greeter.emojib`. This is an Emojicode Byte-Code File, which can be executed by the Emojicode Real-Time Engine. So let’s type:

```
emojicode greeter.emojib
```

Congratulations! You’ve written your first program. But how does it actually work?

It’s simple: `🔤Howdy, partner!🔤` is a string literal. Every character between two 🔤 is then part of the string.

Then we call the 😀 method on this string. And guess what, it just prints the string to the standard output. The thing to notice here is, that the method is actually called by putting its emoji **before the object**. It’s also noteworthy that Emojicode usually does not use parentheses around arguments to method calls.

## Warming Up

Let’s call a few more methods to warm up. We’ll now write a method to convert English into *Pig Latin*. This is a very easy language because to get the Pig Latin word you just have to move the first letter of the English word to the end and add *ay*.

In Emojicode you can easily extend every existing class, so to follow good object-orientated practices we’ll extend the string class to have a method to convert an English word to Pig Latin. Add the following into the file:

```
🐋 ￼🔡 🍇
  🐖 🐷 ➡️ 🔡￼ 🍇
  ￼￼
  🍉
🍉
```

`🐋 ￼🔡 🍇` says: Extend the class `🔡` (That’s the string class). `🐖 🐷 ➡️ 🔡￼` declares a method called `🐷` and
returning an instance of the 🔡 class￼￼.

Ok, let’s take the first letter of this string by using the `🔪` method, which is, according to the [documentation](../packages/s/t5535756609.html#m🔪), capable of giving us just part of a string. It’s signature is:

```
🐖 🔪 from 🚂 length 🚂 ➡️ 🔡
```   

This tells us that the `🔪` method takes two arguments named `from` and `length`, both of them must be of the type 🚂.
🚂 stands for an integer, and that the method returns an instance of 🔡.

Let’s call it on the string we are currently working on.

```
🐖 🐷 ➡️ 🔡￼ 🍇
￼￼  🔪 🐕 0 1
🍉
```

This should get us a string containing the first character of the string we are currently working on which is represented by 🐕. You can compare 🐕 to `this` or `self` in other languages. However, we need to store the result somewhere.

```
🐖 🐷 ➡️ 🔡￼ 🍇
￼￼  🍮 firstLetter 🔪 🐕 0 1
🍉
```

The above code stores the result into the variable `firstLetter`. The variable is actually declared and initialized here. The compiler will detect that the variable hasn’t been used before and will look at the return of the assignment value. The variable’s type will be set to the return value’s type.

Now we need to get the rest of the word.

```
🐖 🐷 ➡️ 🔡￼ 🍇
￼￼  🍮 firstLetter 🔪 🐕 0 1
  🍮 rest 🔪 🐕 1 📏 🐕
🍉
```

The `📏` method returns the length of a string, so we get the whole string. You can see that the result of the `📏`  method is used as argument to 🔪.

Finally we just need to concatenate `firstLetter`, `rest` and *ay* and return it from the method.

```
🐖 🐷 ➡️ 🔡 🍇
  🍮 firstLetter 🔪 🐕 0 1
  🍮 rest 🔪 🐕 1 📏 🐕
  🍎 🍪 rest firstLetter 🔤ay🔤 🍪
🍉
```

The `🍪`s are the most efficient way of concatenating strings. You can wrap any amount of strings between `🍪` and you will get them concatenated into one string. You should already know the 🍎 from above. It returns a value from the method.

Well done! Let’s update the 🏁 method to give us a few examples.

```
🐇 🐼 🍇
  🐇🐖 🏁 ➡️ 🚂 🍇
    😀 🐷 🔤cat🔤
    😀 🐷 🔤development🔤
    😀 🐷 🔤computer🔤
    🍎 0
  🍉
🍉
```

Compile and let’s see:

```
emojicodec greeter.emojic
emojicode greeter.emojib
```

```
atcay
evelopmentday
omputercay
```

Cool! We have successfully translated English words into Pig Latin.

## What to do next

I highly recommend you to read through the [Language Reference](../reference) which is a bit more formal.

Of course try and fail is also a good way to learn something...
