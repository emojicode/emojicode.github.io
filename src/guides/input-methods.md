# Input methods

So, you've installed Emojicode and are willing to spend the rest of the weekend and maybe your life programming with it. It is a language crafted by Gods, you think. But, suddendly, a realization comes to you. Your keyboard has no worthy symbols. Just those letters you used for your old programming activities.

Do not fear, for Gods were not crazy when they crafted Emojicode! They also created input methods and shortcuts so you could code in this beautiful language.

## macOS Emojipicker

Entering Emoji on macOS should be as easy as falling off a log. Just press
^⌘Space and an emoji picker will show up. If you start dragging it, it will be
become a window and stay open so you can easily enter code.

## Editor Syntaxes

Syntax files and bundles are also available that allow you to write Emojicode
in your favorite editor:

* [Emojicode Sublime Syntax](https://github.com/orez-/Emojicode-Sublime-Syntax) by orez-
* [Emojicode TextMate Bundle](https://github.com/ThatsJustCheesy/Emojicode-TM) by ThatsJustCheesy

## IBus

Available for GNU/Linux and other *nix-like OSes, this input method, when correctly configured will let you switch between Emojis and other, not so worthy, things.

If you happen to run Arch Linux you would have to follow this:  [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus) and then install the AUR `ibus-uniemoji-git` package. If you have problems with any package after doing so, reinstall `gtk2`.

For other OSes, the installation is similar. Please do refer to your OS documentation.

## Compose (Hex code)

Although less user-friendly, it might feel more hacky for you. Just hit `ctrl` + `shift` + `u`, type the hex code of the Emoji and then press `enter`.
