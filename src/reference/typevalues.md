# Types as Values

Emojicode allows you to pass types as value. You can then call
type methods on these types or instantiate them.

## The Type of a Type Value

Naturally, if you treat a type as value, this value must have a type as well.
This type has the same name as the type the value represents but prefixed with
the emoji, with which the type was defined. Let’s take a look at these
examples:

```
🖍🆕 the_integer_type 🕊🔢
🖍🆕 a_class_type 🐇🔡
```

In the example above two variables were declared. `the_integer_type` which can
hold the type 🔢 and `a_class_type` which can hold the type 🔡.

Note that you cannot use any built-in type like ⚪️ or 🔵 or optionals or errors
as value. Furthermore, the type must always be prefixed with the appropriate
emoji. A value type, for example, must be prefixed with 🕊 or the compiler will
raise an error.

```syntax
$type-value$-> $type-value-type-emoji$ $type$
$type-value-type-emoji$-> 🐇 | 🕊 | 🦃 | 🐊
```

## Creating Type Values

Now let us create a type value. Type values are created exactly the same
way their types are declared. So in order to populate our variables we can
write this:

```
🕊🔢 ➡️ 🖍the_integer_type
🐇🔡 ➡️ 🖍a_class_type
```

Voila!

## Compatibility of Type Values

With the exception of classes, the type of two type values are only compatible
if they are identical.
The type of a class type value, however,
is compatible with the type of the type value of its superclass.

The following is therefore correct:

```
🐇 🌷 🍇🍉

🐇 🌺 🌷 🍇🍉

🏁 🍇
  🖍🆕 a_flower_type 🐇🌷
  🐇🌺 ➡️ 🖍a_flower_type
🍉
```

## Using Type Values

You can use type values whenever a type expression is expected with ⬛️:

```syntax
$type-from-expr$-> ⬛️ $expression$
```

*expresssion* must naturally evaluate to a type value.

`👇` is a shortcut for `⬛️👇` when a type expression is expected.

The following example stores three different type values in a list,
instantiates them at run-time and calls a method on these instances:

```
