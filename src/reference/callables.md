# Callables

Emojicode supports a type called Callables which is comparable to function types in other programming languages. Callables are actually just objects and can therefore be stored in variables, passed into other methods, etc.

## Type

The callable type is declared using this syntax:

```
🍇 [type ...] [➡️ returnType]🍉
```

Each *type* stands for one argument of that type. You can specify a *returnType*. If no return type is specified the callable is assumed to return Nothingness.

Examples:

```
🍇🚂➡️🔡🍉 👴Takes an integer argument and returns a string
🍇➡️🔣🍉 👴Takes no arguments and returns a symbol
🍇🍉 👴Takes no arguments and returns nothing(ness).
```

## Calling a Callable

The 🍭 must be used to call a callable.

```
🍭 callable [arguments ...]
```

*callable* must be a callable. Of course you must provide the required number of correctly typed arguments.

Example of calling a callable:

```
👴 greet is of type 🍇🔡🍉
🍭 greet 🔤Bob🔤
```

## Capturing a Method Call

You can *capture* a method call on a given object. This creates a function taking all arguments the method would take and returning the same value the method would return, this function however will always execute the method on the same object.

Example:

```
🍮 string 🔤Strawberry🔤

🍮 append 🌶 📝 string

😀 🍭 append 🔟!
😀 🍭 append 🔟?
```

## Closure

You can define closures which remember the environment in which they were defined. The basic syntax to define a closure is:

```
🍇 [(variable type) ...] [➡️ returnType]

🍉
```

This is basically the same syntax that applies to methods and initializers. There may be any number of `variable type`. These define the parameters the closure takes. `variable` must be a valid variable name and type and valid type.

Example:

```
🍮 greet 🍇 name 🔡 ➡️ 🔡
  🍮 i ➖ 📏 name 1
  🍮 out 🔤🔤

  🔁 ➡️ i 0 🍇
    🍮 out 📝 out 🍺🔬 name i
    🍳 i
  🍉
  🍎 out
🍉
```

The above is a very simple example of a closure that simply reverses a given string.

Let’s take a look at a more advanced use of a closure:

```
🐇🐖 🙋 name 🔡 ➡️ 🍇🚂➡️🔡🍉 🍇
  🍎 🍇 hour 🚂 ➡️ 🔡
    🍊 😛 hour 12 🍇
      🍎 🍪 🔤Have a good lunch, 🔤 name🍪
    🍉
    🍎 🍪 🔤Hello, 🔤 name🍪
  🍉
🍉
```

Here we’ve got a class method that returns a closure. The closure actually closes over the `name` variable here and copies it value so that it can be used when the closure is called later.

Now if we call the class method we’ll get a closure:

```
🍮 walfriedGreeter 🍩🙋🐀 🔤Walfried🔤
```

Now we can call the closure with an argument for `hour`:

```
😀 🍭 walfriedGreeter 7
😀 🍭 walfriedGreeter 12
```

This will produce:

```
Hello, Walfried
Have a good lunch, Walfried
```

>!N Closures **copy** the closured **local variables**. If you modify one of the copied variable only the copy local to the closure will be modified.
>!N
>!N **Instance variables** are **not copied** and really change when modified inside a closure.
