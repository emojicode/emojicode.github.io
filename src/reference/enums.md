# Enumerations

Enumerations are a special kind of value type that represent a set of options
from which one can be chosen.

## Defining an Enumeration

The syntax to define an enumeration is:

<pre class="syntax">
$enum$-> 🦃 $type-identifier$ $type-body$
$enum-value$-> 🔘 $emoji$
</pre>

For example:

```
🦃 📜 🍇
  🔘🌭
  🔘🍕
  🔘🍔
🍉
```

In this example, an enumeration that named 📜 is defined which offers the values
🌭, 🍕 and 🍔.

## Instantiating an Enumeration

Every enumeration automatically provides intializers for all its options, named
after the option the instance will represent. Like any value type, enumerations
are instantiated with 🔷:

```
🔷📜🍕
```

Enumerations cannot have custom initializers.

## Methods

In the manner of any other value types, enumerations can have methods. The
following examples shows an enumeration which provides a method that returns
a textual description of the chosen value:

```
🦃 ⏰ 🍇
  🔘🥓
  🔘🥞
  🔘🥐

  🐖 🔡 ➡️ 🔡 🍇
    🍊 😛 🐕 🔷⏰🥐 🍇

    🍉
    🍊 😛 🐕 🔷⏰🥞 🍇

    🍊 😛 🐕 🔷⏰🥓 🍇
      🍎 🔤Bacon🔤
    🍉
    🍎 🔤🔤
  🍉

```

## Comparing Enums

😛 can be used to compare whether two enum instances are equal:

```
🍮 a 🔷📜🍕
🍮 b 🔷📜🍕
🍊 😛 a b 🍇
  😀 🔤Equal🔤
🍉
```
