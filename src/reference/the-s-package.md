# The s package

This chapter provides a very brief overview of the s package and its most
important classes.

The s package can be compared to what’s called standard library in other
programing languages. It provides some of the most important classes and value
types to write meaningful programs.

>!H This chapter only introduces the most important classes although there are
>!H many more.
>!H
>!H You can browse the whole API of the s package [here](../packages/s/).

## 👌 🚂 🚀 🔣

You’ve already got to know the types 👌 🚂 🚀 🔣 in a previous chapter. These
types are, of course, also defined in the s package.

## 🔡 Strings

In Emojicode a string is an ordered immutable collection of symbols (or easily
speaking a text). Strings are represented by the 🔡 class which represent a
collection of 🔣, a primitive type representing a single Unicode code point.

### String Literals

You can include strings in your code by surrounding the characters by a pair of
🔤:

```
🍦 aString 🔤This is a string.🔤
```

You can of course also create an empty string:

```
🍦 emptyString 🔤🔤
```

Such a string is 0 symbols long and doesn’t have any value.

Obviously, you cannot just include the 🔤 symbol in a string literal as it would
be understood as the ending of the string. You can however *escape* the 🔤 using
the ❌.

```
🍦 aboutStringLiterals 🔤A string literal begins with a ❌🔤 symbol.🔤
```

If you want to include the ❌ symbol in a string literal you will need to escape
it as well:

```
🍦 theEscapeSymbol 🔤The escape character is ❌❌ (red cross).🔤
```

The escape character can also be used to produce the following characters:

- `❌❌` ❌
- `❌n` New line (`U+A0`)
- `❌t` Tab (`U+09`)
- `❌r` Carriage return (`U+0D`)
- `❌e` Escape (`U+1B`)

All other combinations of a ❌ and another character lead to a compiler error.

Formally, the syntax is:

<pre class="syntax">
$string-literal$-> 🔤 [$string-literal-characters$] 🔤
$string-literal-characters$-> $string-literal-character$ |  $string-literal-character$ $string-literal-characters$
$string-literal-character$-> $unicode$ except 🔤 except ❌ | $string-escape-sequence$
$string-escape-sequence$-> ❌ $string-escape-tail$
$string-escape-tail$-> n | t | r | e
</pre>

### Comparing Strings

If you want to determine whether to strings represent the same value, you can
use the equality method 😛.

```
😛 🍪🔤Straw🔤 🔤berries🔤🍪 🔤Strawberries🔤
```

>!H Note that the example above used a method call. 😛 is a method defined in
>!H the 🔡 class. You’ll learn more about classes and methods in the next
>!H chapter. For now, just remember that methods are called by placing an emoji
>!H before the object on which the method should be called.

### Concatenating Strings

To add two or more strings together (*concatenate*) you should use the 🍪
language struct. Wrap all strings you want to concatenate between two 🍪. They
will get concatenated in order of appearance into one string.

```
🍦 string1 🔤Hello 🔤
🍦 string2 🔤my dear🔤

😀 🍪 string1 string2 🔤 World!🔤 🍪
```

🍪s are the most efficient way of concatenating strings as the compiler can
🍪optimize the concatenation. Please note that 🍪s are not methods but part
of the language.

The syntax formally is:

<pre class="syntax">
$concatenate-literal$-> 🍪 $concatenate-expressions$ 🍪
$concatenate-expressions$-> $concatenate-expression$ | $concatenate-expression$ $concatenate-expressions$
$concatenate-expression$-> $expression$ except $concatenate-literal$
</pre>

### String Pooling

At compile time all strings will be pooled. This means that each string literal
with the same value occurs only once in the bytecode file and at runtime equal
strings created from string literals will be represented by the same object.

Consider the following example. While the first comparison of object references
will evaluate to true, the second one won’t.

    😜 🔤Strawberries🔤 🔤Strawberries🔤 👴true
    😜 🍪🔤Straw🔤 🔤berries🔤🍪 🔤Strawberries🔤 👴false

>!N Never use 😜 to compare strings. Use 😛 instead.

### String Mutablility

Strings are immutable. This means that you can’t modify any string. You can
however call methods on strings that return modified copies of the orginal
string, but those themselves are then immutable again.

## 🍨 Lists

Lists are ordered mutable collections of values. They are represeneted by the 🍨
class. Their sizes are theoretically unlimited, but practically hardware and the
fact that Emojicode’s integers have an upper bound makes them limited.

Lists are optimized for fast by index access. You can access by index, pop and
append in `O(1)`.

List indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java. A negative index is assumed to be
relative to the end of the list — that is, an index of -1 indicates the last
element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on.

### The 🍨 Type

The 🍨 class is generic and needs to know of what type the values are. If you use
the class name you will also have to specify this generic argument. To specify a
list that can hold strings you would write:

    🍨🐚🔡

If you created a list like this

    🍮 list 🔷 🍨🐚🔡 🐸

you would only be able to add strings to the list and you will always get back
strings from the list. (The syntax used above will be discussed in
[Classes](classes.html).)

### List Literals

You can create a list just by listing the values for the list between 🍨 and 🍆.
The example below creates a list with the values `14`, `67`, `2434`.

    🍨 14 67 2434 🍆

The compiler will try to infer the generic type argument for the list.

<pre class="syntax">
$list-literal$-> 🍨 [$expressions$] 🍆
$expressions$-> $expression$ | $expression$ $expressions$
</pre>

## 🍯 Dictionaries

Dictionaries can be used to assign values to string keys. The size of a
dictionary is theoretically unlimited.

### The 🍯 Type

The 🍯 class is also generic and requires you to specify the type of the values.
For instance if the values were booleans the type would be written like this:

    🍯🐚👌

### Dictionary Literals

The shortcut syntax to create a dictionary is:

<pre class="syntax">
$dictionary-literal$-> 🍯 [$kv-pairs$] 🍆
$kv-pairs$-> $kv-pair$ $kv-pairs$ | $kv-pair$
$kv-pair$-> $key$ $expression$
$key$-> $expression$
</pre>

*key* must be a string. The compiler will try to infer the generic type argument
for the dictionary.

Here’s an example for a dictionary that associates artists with their birthplaces:

```
🍯
  🔤Aaron Copland🔤 🔤Brooklyn🔤
  🔤Michael Jackson🔤 🔤Gary🔤
  🔤Falco🔤 🔤Vienna🔤
🍆
```

## ⏩ Ranges

Emojicode supports a range type called ⏩. A range is an immutable sequence of
numbers, or more strictly speaking of integers.

A range is always defined by three values: *start*, *stop* and *step*.

Every number `f(x) = start + x * step`
that matches the constraint `start ≤ f(x) < stop` is an element of the range. If
`step` is negative the constraint `stop < f(x) ≤ start` applies instead.

Ranges can be created by using the shortcut syntax, which is depending on your
needs either

<pre class="syntax">
$range-literal$-> $range-literal-with-step$ $range-literal-without-step$
$range-literal-with-step$-> ⏭ $start$ $stop$ $step$
$start$-> $expression$
$stop$-> $expression$
$step$-> $expression$
</pre>

or

<pre class="syntax">
$range-literal-without-step$-> ⏩ $start$ $stop$
</pre>

The latter uses 1 as *step* value if *start* is less than *stop*, otherwise
-1 is used as *step* value. If you provide 0 as *step* value *step* will be
set to an appropriate value as described before.

Ranges can be very helpful in combination with 🔂 if you need to repeat
something for a specific number of times:

```
🔂 i ⏭ 0 10 2 🍇
  😀 🔡 i 10
🍉
```
```
🔂 i ⏩ 0 10 🍇
  😀 🔡 i 10
🍉
```
```
🔂 i ⏩ 10 0 🍇
  😀 🔡 i 10
🍉
```
```
🔂 i ⏭ 100 -10 -10 🍇
  😀 🔡 i 10
🍉
```

The result of running these examples would be:

```
0
2
4
6
8
```
```

```
